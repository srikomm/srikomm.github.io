Originally I had my home loan with LICHFL. I wanted to go with SBI (preferably MaxGain), but while taking a fresh loan SBI 
asked for a lot of documentation, multiple trips to the SBI branch whereas LICHFL had a tie up with my builder and I wasn't 
even required to leave my house even once during the whole process, an agent used to come to my home for all the signatures 
and any documentation required from us. So I went with LICHFL at that point of time thinking I can transfer it at a later date
as that would be a much easier process. 

Few pain points with LICHFL
- No online facility to do prepayment
- Monthly reducing average
- Prepayment would require a visit to the branch and would require proof of funds

## Initial talks with SBI

After going through reddit and my personal experience, I wanted to go with SBI for the loan transfer even though there were few 
other PSU banks which were offering .05-.1% lower interest rates compared to SBI, but I wanted the reliability of their internet 
banking experience as this is going to be a long duration. So I went to the nearest SBI branch and started talking to them about 
the transfer and this is what the process involved.

1. First thing is to get few documents called LOD (List of Documents) from my exisiting bank/NBFC.
2. Meanwhile, ready all the documents mentioned if you don't have them already (listed below)
3. Get valuation and legal done for the home/property
4. Apply for home loan transfer and then for top-up

## List of documents required
### From applicant/co-applicant(s)
1. Adhaar card
2. Pan card
3. Last 6 months payslips
4. Last 2 years form 16
5. Joining letter of current company
6. Old company's relieving letter and joining letter (for all the job changes in last 2 years)
7. Bank statement for last 1 year of salary account
8. Current company ID card

### From old Bank/NBFC
1. LOD (List of Documents)
2. Loan sanction letter
3. Loan statement for last 3 years
4. Loan outstanding letter

### Related to property
1. All link documents (basically, these documents list all the previous owners of the land for last 50-100 years or upto available)
2. Plan & proceedings of the apartment
3. Latest house tax reciept
4. Sale deed of the flat

## Valuation and Legal

For valuation, a person visits our home and verifies whether the house actually exists or not and takes some pictures of the house
and also measures the area of the house (they're not very particular about this from what I noticed, they just verify if the measurements
mentioned in other docs like registration/loan application are true). I was required to give him "travelling charges" of 500 (later got to
that this is a bribe given to him, so that he doesn't undervalue our house). For the actual valuation charges, I paid their company 6000 rupees.

Once this is done, all our docs are sent for legal, from what I understand, they verify the legality of all the documents we have provided for 
the home loan, the link documents and home registration documents etc, and then attest them. I had to pay them another 5000 rupees.

Both these fees, are apparently proportional to the value of the loan, i.e; if the loan amount is higher, these will also go higher.

## Applying for loan transfer

Once both valuation and legal are done, we start the application process for the loan transfer. From the valuation, you will get to know how much
loan you can apply for and how much top up loan you can take. My bank gave me a couple of forms to fill, most of the fields are self-explanatory. 
Few fields, I took help from the assisstant manager in the bank to fill them. Once it is filled and signed by all the co-applicants, you submit it
to the branch and then they start the online process. Basically, they upload all of this information in to their systems and then send it to a 
regional branch for final verification and then for approval. 

In my case, they sent back the application to my branch saying a "deviation", since I wasn't working for few months in the last 3 years in between. 
So I had to write an explanation letter, as to why I wasn't recieving any salary for those months. I checked with the bank manager whether to 
mention health reasons, since it would look better, but he suggested that it wouldn't matter and I filled it with genuine reasons, that I intended 
for the break to be only 2 months but due to lack of hiring in the IT industry at that  time, it took few more months for me find a new job. 
Then they attached this explanation letter to the loan application and resent it to the head office and then after 3 days my loan was approved. 

So immediately a loan account was opened on my name and the loan amount is disbursed to that account.
Now I got a loan outstanding letter from LICHFL on the next day, this mentions the exact loan outstanding amount for that particular day and then go
to SBI to get a DD for the exact amount and then take it back to LICHFL to submit it. Once this is done, LICHFL takes 10-15 days to get the orginal
home documents which are stored in their head office (in my case visakhapatnam). We'll get an SMS & an email once they reach our LICHFL branch and we 
need to go along with a current bank's representative to collect them. 

Note that, both parties need to be present, i.e; loan applicant and the new bank's representative and then the documents are directly given to the 
bank representative. Please make sure to go to your bank along with the rep and make sure they're submitted to loan officer/bank manager there. 

And then we follow a similar process for the home top up loan as well and it is sent for verification and then approval. Once that is also done, the 
amount is disbursed into another loan account created for the top up loan. 


## Things to consider/be on the lookout for

- Agent from bank will always try to push few shady things to complete the process fatser. For ex, once he was asking me to sign where my mom's 
signature was required. In these cases, it's best always to consult bank manager/asst manager, as they always suggest the right thing to do.
- SBI pushed very hard for me to take insurance on the laon, I was very steadfast that I wouldn't require it and rejected it every mention of it.
Note that this is different from property insurance, which is for damages like earthquake, fire etc. 
- During the final signing of the loan after approval, the SBI folks tried to sneakily make me sign on the insurance docs as well. There were 
more than 300 signatures required from me that day and they just slipped in the insurance docs inside another bundle of docs, but I was briefly
looking at the title of every page, and caought what they were trying to pull on me.
- And then there was pressure from them to assign my Term insurance to SBI, whose value is much higher than the home loan amount. I didn't give in 
to those demands and politely refused at every stage.
