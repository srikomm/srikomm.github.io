Ferry travel & street art

ready by 9 & at the reception
took a cab to jetty, eagle square
boarded ferry
experience was good

after getting down from ferry
2 options
kola kedah -> alar setar -> penang train station -> hotel
kola kedah -> hotel
after calculating, we took option 2
this guy tried to skim us for some ringetts
by saying tolls for 30RM
Grab saved us by not allowing the driver to add more than 15RM for the ride

checked in to the hotel
this is a 2.5BHK, hugeeeeeee
with kitchen & all
got freshened up

left for georgetown street art
lots of picteresque places
hopped from one street art to another

clan jettys

went to food streets
food was great
