## Ferry travel & street art

Our time in Langkawi has come to an end and we were going to Georgetown today morning on the ferry :yay:.
We were travel ready by 9AM & met at the hotel reception and then took a cab to jetty, eagle square.
Btw, did I forget to mention about the Grab app here. 
It's very convinent to book a cab to anywhere using the Grab app and since there were 3 of us, we always booked a cab as the cab fare split amongst 
the 3 of us was almost all the time closer to public transport fare or sometimes even lesser. Only once during the entire trip did we have had to wait a lot of time to get a cab, when we were at the base of the Sky Bridge. Almost all the time in KL, we'd get a cab in 2-3 mins. 

We have reached the jetty square and boarded the ferry. It was almost like crossing immigration at an airport. 
We had to cross multiple checks to finally board the ferry. I took the window seat ;p and the ride was very smooth and comfortable.
The overall experience of the ferry was very good.
Pro tip - book the ferry tickets in advance, somedays they're sold out very quickly, so not every day you can reach eagle square & get tickets for the ferry. Thankfully, our hotel receptionist had an app using which we could directly book tickets for the ferry and we apid him in cash.

Once we got down from the ferry, we had 2 options to reach our hotel.
public transport - kola kedah -> alar setar -> penang train station -> hotel
cab using grab - kola kedah -> hotel
after some intense calculating, we took option 2 as we were tired and wanted to reach the hotel ASAP.

This cab driver tried to skim us for some ringetts, by saying tolls are extra 30RM, which grab app doesn't include in the fare according to him.
Grab saved us by not allowing the driver to add more than 15RM for the ride in the app. We just paid him whatever grab showed us to pay.
