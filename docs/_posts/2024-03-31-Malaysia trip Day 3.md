## Island hopping & Billa bridge

At 9:30AM in the morning, we left from the hotel.
Good thing about taking a nice hotel, we got to leave from the hotel deck directly, yes, our hotel had a private deck.
Island hopping as the name suggests involves hopping various islands, I was assuming the count would be 10 or more,
but they just chose the bare minimum number of islands to be qualified as islands; yes, we just landed on two islands during this activity.

But the guy driving our boat was a daredevil. 
He was speeding through water like anything.  
There he's with pride on his face just after finishing the ride.

We went through a lot of islands, _I mean sped past_.
After 45 minutes of this, we stopped at an island which had a Geoforest.
It had some water sports activities.
We did a 15–20 mins hike to reach the centre of the island where the water activities were, and there's a lake there.
I went kayaking for the first time and didn't know going in that it would be that tiresome. 
Had some avocado juice on the island for 20RM.

Here are some of the pictures that were captured along the way.

Then some more speed boating.   


We were then dropped on an island with one hour to spare.
The island had these beautiful huts if you want to rent them out for a day.

Took some pictures.
Threw some stones into the ocean.
Came back to the hotel room around 2PM.

Stupid me locked my stuff in the room locker. 
Staff tried forever unsuccessfully to unlock it. 
Then we left for the sky bridge, or as I like to call it Billa Bridge.
Thought we'd have lunch after taking the tickets for the SkyBridge at the base of the mountain, 
but we'd just arrived in time for one of the last batches to be allowed up the mountain. 

## SkyBridge

We took a cable car from the bottom of the mountain, and there were two stops until they reached the top of the hill and returned back.
The First stop is at a viewpoint, and the second stop is at the top of the mountain. 
From here we'd need to go down a bit to reach the SkyBridge. 
We can either take the steps or take a paid elevator to go down and reach the SkyBridge. 
The sky bridge was amazing.
Did I already use the phrase “Something's can’t be captured on a camera or using words no matter how skilled the writer/photographer is”.
If island hopping was the first one of that sort this trip, I felt this might be the best thing we've visited for the whole trip.

First, we stopped for a viewpoint. 
Then we went to the top.
Had to climb down using steps to go to the infamous Billa Bridge.
TBH the bridge itself was a little bit disappointing, the film showed it to be huge, it was a lot smaller IRL.
Nevertheless, the view and overall the whole experience were breathtaking for lack of a better word.

By the time we had finished, all of this, it was 5:30PM.
So we thought we would go for iftar ramadan buffet.

## Dinner

This was the view from our hotel deck just as the sun was setting.

![hotel deck sunset](/assets/images/ml_trip/day_03/hotel_deck_evening.jpg)

We were searching for all sorts of places trying to optimise the distance, time and cab fare, 
little did we know that we had one in our own resort.
So we just went there.
The options were just simple too many.

Cost - 80 RM per person

## Pantai Chenang

Then we went to the city to get some things from a Sleven. 
We casually walked to the nearby beach, and delightfully, we found a live fire show.
The presenter/performer was amazing and hilarious.
And the stunts they performed were mmmaaahhh.

<p>
This show sponsored by Meena Life Insurance.        
If you are on fire, the beach is just that way, just run.

Took a cab back home.
Slept like a baby.
