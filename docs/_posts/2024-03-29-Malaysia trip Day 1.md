# KL airport and Immigration

Landed in the KUL airport early in the morning at around 6AM. The First thing we did was to take three local SIMs, one for each of us.
It costed around `45RM` for a 30-day pack. Our trip was for 10 days, but options were for either 7 days or 30 days, so had to take those.

Then we cleared ourselves through the immigration check.
Three of us were traveling, for two of us it was seamless, only question asked was, `How long is your stay?` and then the person at the
counter took our photos and fingerprints and stamped our passport and let us through, for us, it hardly took five mins.
They didn't even ask us to show our MDAC,
But for that one lucky friend, he was asked to show, hotel booking(s) for the trip throughout, and return flight tickets etc., for him,
it probably took around 15 minutes.
We had booked all of our hotels beforehand, so no hassles there.
We collected our luggage and got freshened up a bit in the airport and then booked a cab to our Hotel via Grab.

This was a very quick ride from the airport to our hotel.
The Guy didn't know his car had a break.
He was a great driver though.
The ride was seamless and at no point we felt unsafe.
Dude beat Google Maps ETA by about 15 minutes.
He felt passionate about driving, his car was well maintained and had a custom paint job.

We reached our hotel by 9 AM, but our checkin was at 3PM, so left the luggage at the reception.
I think this is a common practice here, no hassles in keeping the luggage at the reception.
In fact, by the time we came back to check in, there were easily 200 bags at the reception,
and it took us a few minutes just to find our luggage in the mountain of bags.

# Breakfast

Went out for breakfast here - [Cafe:in House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uu26YdMcRi8tK6Hw5).
Had a heavy breakfast since we were exhausted from the plane ride.
cost - 107RM

# Merdekka Square & Islamic Arts Museum

To kill time, we went to [Merdekka square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EA2kFNbEu8KjAQaA7).
This is where they perform the annual independence day parade.

Then we walked towards [National Mosque of Malaysia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mwSQc5KCJEP3yy9RA),
but we weren't allowed to go in as it was Friday and some prayer was happening,
then we strolled to [Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8tHL3esWDhzUAM7dA)
Entry cost - 20MYR per person

There was some artwork using arabic calligraphy and them being symmetrical, I couldn't help but take a lot of pictures there.

Some undertones of propaganda in the museum, but which museum doesn't, surprised to see a lot of Indian artifacts here.
Three of us spoke about who looted what and when from India and how rich we could've been if not for that.
I guess Indians can't escape from this conversation in any big museums around the world :cry:
Some artifacts below.

# Check in to the hotel

We then went back to the hotel around 2PM to check in.
The receptionist was strict about time and didn't let us in until 2:30 PM.
All of us were tired from the journey and all the walking, so we hit the bed straight, or at least that's what I thought
My friends went to the infinity pool on top of the hotel, 51st floor.
The View from there was amazing.

![pool_view_one_twin_towers](/assets/images/ml_trip/day_01/pool_view/IMG_1817.jpg)

# Twin towers and water show

Around 6:40PM, I woke up, got freshened up again, and all of us left for the KL tower's water show.
On the way took some pictures in front of the twin towers.
We reached there just in time as there were only 3 shows 7PM, 8PM, 9PM we caught the 8PM one.

# Jalan Alor Food street

Then we left for the [Jalan Alor Food Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9XcYDBHdHcY3Uopt5) in **Bukit Bintang**.  
Nothing much to add, the following photos will convey the range of foods that were available.

# Dinner

This is what we ended up eating for Dinner (of course, along with some things from the street).   
Cost - 129RM

![crab](/assets/images/ml_trip/day_01/20240329_225641.jpg)

We walked back to the hotel after spending about 2–3 hrs on the food street.
Visited a 7-Eleven store in between.

Pro-tip: Visit a 7-Eleven every day and buy some water & bananas for the next day.

[KKR made a mockery of RCB's total](https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-scores/89703/rcb-vs-kkr-10th-match-indian-premier-league-2024).   
I can't take GG hugging Virat.
