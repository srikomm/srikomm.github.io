# Day 1

Landed in the KUL airport early in the morning at around 6AM. First thing we did was to take 3 local SIMs, one for each of us.
It costed around `45RM` for a 30-day pack. Our trip was for 10 days, but options were for either 7 days or 30 days, so had to take those.

Then we cleared ourselves through the immigration check.
3 of us were travelling, for 2 of us it was seamless, only question asked was, `How long is your stay?` and then the person at the counter
took our photos and fingerprints and stamped our passport and let us through, for us it hardly took 5 mins. They didn't even ask us to show
our MDAC, But for that one lucky friend, he was asked to show, hotel booking(s) for the trip throughout, and return flight tickets etc, for
him, it
probably took around 15 mins. We had booked all of our hotels beforehand, so no hassles there. We collected our luggage and got freshened
up a bit in the airport and then booked a cab to our Hotel via Grab.

This was a very quick ride from the airport to our hotel. Guy didn't know his car had a break. He was a very good driver though.
The ride was seamless and at no point we felt unsafe. Dude beat Google Maps ETA by about 15 mins. He felt passionate about driving, his car 
was well maintained and had a custom paint job.

We reached hotel by 9 AM, but our checkin was at 3PM, so left the luggage at the reception. I think this is a common practise here, no 
hassles in keeping the luggage at the reception. In fact by the time we came back to check in, there were easily 200 bags at the reception, 
and it took us a few mins just to find our luggage in the mountain of bags.

Went out for breakfast [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uu26YdMcRi8tK6Hw5)

day parade.

We walked towards [National Mosque of Malaysia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mwSQc5KCJEP3yy9RA) but we weren't allowed to go in as it was Friday 
and some prayer was happening, then we strolled to [Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8tHL3esWDhzUAM7dA)

some undertones of propaganda in the museum, but which museum doesn't, surprised to see lot of Indian artifacts here. 
3 of us spoke about who looted what and when from India and how rich we could've been if not for that.
I guess, Indians can't escape from this conversations in any big museums around the world :cry:

then came back to the hotel around 2PM to check in, receptionist was strict about time and didn't let us in until 2:30 PM
all of us were tired from the journey and all the walking, so we hit the bed striaght or atleast that's what I thought
my friends went to the infinity pool on top of the hotel

Around 6:40PM, I woke up, got freshened up again and all of us left for the KL tower's water show.
We reached there just in time as there're only 3 shows 7PM, 8PM, 9PM, we caught the 8PM one
