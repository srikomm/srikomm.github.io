# Flight to Langkawi

Woke up early around 8:30 AM, since we had to go to KUL airport and catch a flight to Langkawi.
Freshened up, checked out of the hotel and took a cab to the airport.
Fastags in malaysia are more evolved compared to India, except for one small thing.
There are multiple providers and each had their own separate lanes at the tollgate and each had multiple ways of authenticating payments.
Mostly they were accepting touch-n-go cards, and a few others RFID.
I feel with RFID as standard, we've done better this part of the ecosystem.

Flew Malaysian airlines, the journey was only about 45 minutes.
Their in-flight safety instructions were composed into a catchy song and felt much better compared to the BS Indigo dolls out.
Even for a 45-minute journey, they gave a small packet of salted peanuts.

[Langkawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langkawi) is an island surrounded by a set of small islands.
The view while landing was out of this world.

Landed and then went directly to the hotel and checked in.
By this time we were famished.

# Lunch

We went to an Indian restaurant of all places, as it was located inside of our hotel and had a buffet, this was decent.   
Cost - MYR 40 per person

Took rest for about half an hour.
Our hotel, [Resort World](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3gWatWpk98dTNuNN6) was located on the beach.
They had tie-ups with all the activities we can do in Langkawi, and this helped us save a lot of time.
We booked activities for the next couple of days there itself.

# Pantai Cenang & Eagle square (Jetty)

Then we went to the [Pantai Cenang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LjqcywZiS2kZ48Hq5) beach.
Nothing exciting there, so we strolled there for a few mins, and then we went to Eagle square or as the locals call it, the 'Jetty'.

and no, that's not me standing behind the L.

One more reason we went there was to book tickets for the ferry to Goergetown, Penang for 2 days later.
But we missed the counter-closing time by a whisker.

This was during Ramadan, and a lot of people were breaking fast there as the sun set, and we thought might as well get something and
decided to go to a food street nearby.
Took a cab there.
The Driver was a chatty cathy.
In 15 mins we knew his whole life story.
At the tender age of 25, he already has 2 kids and casually asks me when I'm going to get married.
We even had a discussion about how much dowry he took.
He was shocked when we revealed the amount of money, us South-Indians, especially Telugites spend on a wedding.

# Food street

If there's one thing that Malay's do really well, it's the colorful street food.

Did some chocolate shopping after having some food here. 
Btw, Did I mention Langkawi is duty-free. 
They won't let you forget this at all.
Every other alternate shop on the street has "Duty Free" written on their sign boards.

# Infinity pool
Our hotel had an amazing infinity pool overlooking the ocean.
